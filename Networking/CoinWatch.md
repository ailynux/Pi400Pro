- **Python 3.7+**
- **Pip** (Python package manager)
- **CoinGecko or Coinbase API Key** (if required)
- **Flask** and **GPIO Libraries** (for display on Flask or OLED)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CoinWatch.git
   cd CoinWatch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   - Register on [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) or [Coinbase API](https://www.coinbase.com/) and obtain your API key (if necessary).
   - Save the API key in a `.env` file:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Connect the OLED Screen** (optional):
   - Follow instructions to wire the OLED to your Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
   - Install the necessary GPIO libraries for Python:
     ```bash
     pip install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
     ```

## Configuration

1. **Choose Cryptocurrencies**:
   - In the configuration file (`config.json`), add the symbols of the cryptocurrencies you want to track (e.g., BTC, ETH, DOGE).
   
   ```json
   {
       "cryptos": ["BTC", "ETH", "DOGE"],
       "price_alert_threshold": 5  // Alert if price changes by 5%
   }
   ```

2. **Set Alert Thresholds**:
   - Define your price alert threshold in `config.json`. This value represents the percentage change that will trigger an alert.
