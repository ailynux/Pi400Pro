## Features

- **Stackable Design**: Fits directly on Raspberry Pi’s GPIO, leaving room for additional bonnets or HATs.
- **Display Connector**: Supports various small displays for a compact, cyberdeck-style screen.
- **USB & HDMI Pass-through**: Ports are accessible on the side for easy connection of peripherals.
- **GPIO Breakout**: Access and expand GPIO pins for additional project customization.
- **Cooling Support**: Compatible with low-profile cooling fans.

---

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi (any model with 40-pin GPIO)
- MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi OS installed
- Small display (e.g., 240x240 TFT, OLED)
- Keyboard, mouse, and other USB peripherals (optional)

### Software

- Latest version of Raspberry Pi OS
- SPI and I2C enabled (for displays and additional peripherals)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Connect the Cyberdeck Bonnet**: Align the 40-pin connector on the bonnet with the Raspberry Pi GPIO and gently press down.
2. **Attach Display**: Secure the compatible display to the bonnet’s display connector.
3. **Enable SPI and I2C**:
    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```
   Navigate to **Interface Options** and enable SPI and I2C.

4. **Install Adafruit Libraries**:
   Install required libraries for display and GPIO control.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
    ```

5. **Reboot the Raspberry Pi**:
    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, the Cyberdeck Bonnet is ready to power your projects. To display information or interact with GPIOs, use Python scripts compatible with the Adafruit CircuitPython library. Here’s a sample to get started with the OLED display:

```python
import board
import digitalio
import adafruit_ssd1306

# Set up display
i2c = board.I2C()
display = adafruit_ssd1306.SSD1306_I2C(128, 64, i2c)

# Display text
display.fill(0)
display.text("Cyberdeck Ready!", 0, 0, 1)
display.show()
```

## Configuration

For advanced setups, you may want to:

- **Add a custom splash screen** on startup
- **Configure GPIOs** for additional modules
- **Install utilities** for networking and SSH access for remote control

Refer to the official Raspberry Pi and Adafruit documentation for more configuration tips.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Display Not Working**: Ensure SPI and I2C are enabled, and double-check connections.
2. **No GPIO Access**: Confirm the bonnet is seated properly on the GPIO pins.
3. **Network Issues**: If using a headless setup, ensure Wi-Fi is configured in `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`.
